# WELCOME TO FOUNDATIONS!

__Student Dashboard__

This is where you will be working through the Foundations curriculum. To get started, click on the link to the Sprint you are currently on and work through the readings, primers, and challenges for that sprint. We recommend these be completed in the order they are listed as they will contain information necessary to complete the next part. 

For more details about Foundations refer to the Student Handbook, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask your facilitator directly or on the #foundations slack channel.
