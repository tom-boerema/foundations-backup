# How to Refactor

Refactoring is an important step to becoming a world-class beginner, and it's important to look at your code fresh before refactoring. 

Refactoring is not about solving the problem differently, it's about solving the problem well. 

Good solutions don't just work, they are clear. For example: 

- Use intention-revealing names variables  
- Avoid global variables 
- Declarations on top of function or script
- Initalise Variables when you declare them
- Readable, concise code.
