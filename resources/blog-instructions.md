# Blog Instructions 

### Summary 
For Sprint 2-5 you'll produce blog posts. Each sprint will have a cultural blog post and some sprints will have an additional technical blog post.
These are published to your `http://username.github.io/' page, which is visible to your cohort and anyone else you share the link with. Your engagement with the blog questions and content each sprint counts toward your Foundations assessment.  

## Blog Setup 
In Sprint 1's ["Setup new Repo & Create Blog Challenge"](/sprints/sprint-1/t8-setup-new-repo-and-create-blog.md) you created a new repo github.io and cloned it to your computer. Hopefully you cloned it to a sensible file directory for example:

Example: Good   
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/kiri.github.io`\
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/foundations`\
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/ko-wai-koe`

Example: Incorrect   
`User/Kiri/Dev-Academy/foundations/kiri.github.io` 

## Steps 
Refer to these instructions to creating a blog until you are familiar with it. 

1. Navigate __INTO__ `username.github.io/blog` directory
2. Create a file using the naming convention `sprint#-cultural.html` and `sprint#-technical.html` (e.g. sprint2-cultural.html)
3. Copy and paste [the template](/resources/html-template.html)
4. (FIRST TIME ONLY) Add css file `<link href="your-stylesheet-link-here.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`with `main.css`
5. Update the HTML elements e.g. Title, headers etc.   
6. Add your content 
7. Stage, commit, push 
8. View your blogs on your web browser e.g. `http://username.github.io/blog/sprint1-cultural.html` 

It may take some time between pushing your work to github and github making it viewable, so don't panic if it's not there immediately!
