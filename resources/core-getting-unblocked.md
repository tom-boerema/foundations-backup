## Getting unblocked 

The internet is full of bugs!\
Everything you do as a web developer is process of working towards a state of less broken. 

Sometimes the error will be your code, other times it will be in the tests, in the descriptions or challenges.
Harness your problem solving skills to firstly understand where the error is and secondly to overcome it. 

## Tips and Resources 

- __Punctuation and spelling:__  Have you left out a closing bracket? A semi-colon?  
- __Different browser:__  Does it work in another browser?  
- __Repl.it:__ Does it work on Repl? Are you getting the expected results? 
- __Are others experiencing the problem? Google the exact phrase!__ 
    
    For example, after getting an error we couldn't resolve, we copied and pasted the exact wording of the challenge and found that this issue was known and found that others too were experiencing the problem.

    As well as identifying if this is a common bug, this type of query on google will likely render the correct code also. Check your code and move on. 

- __StackOverflow:__ Over 50 million developers sharing knowledge. 
- __Slack HelpDesk channel:__ Reach out on the EDA Slack channel. Share what it is your trying to achieve, the inputs (your code) and the exact error message. 
- __YouTube FreeCodeCamp:__ FreeCodeCamp publish live coding / code demonstrations. [FreeCodeCamp channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)
- __YouTube FreeCodeCamp Users:__ FreeCodeCamp contributors also create code demo's for challenges. Check out [We Will Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rvr8EdhCg&list=PLF4Fpfzm6Ig3smsMQEqKRTAlgOdoee7AJ) for a demo each challenge if you get stuck.
- __Browser Console:__ Inspect the webpage using the browser console. What can you see?  
- __Comment Out__  

    Comment out portions of the code until all that is left is the portion with the problem. Once you have narrowed down the problem area, begin subtracting elements until the problem goes away. For example, if you've narrowed down the problem to a specific `<div>` and the CSS that styles it, begin by removing one line of CSS at a time.
