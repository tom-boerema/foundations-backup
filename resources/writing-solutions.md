# Writing Solutions - Process and Framework
You're about to jump into learning! So where do you begin?

Begin this process at the beginning of each learning activity
 

## Process 
1. Get intentional and habitual
2. Start your timer
3. Understand: Get clear on what is being asked.
4. Plan: Plan your approach
5. Divide: Break into small steps 
6. Make an attempt at solving it (write Initial Solution) 
7. Get unstuck 
8. Improve your solution (Refactor) 
9. Learn what you learned (Reflect)
10. Practice 


## Why?
_Credit: [Adapted from Richard Reis](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)_

Problem solving is a meta-skill. And thinking like a programmer requires you to problem solve. 
Without a process and framework, this is a likely way you'll go about 'solving' problems:

Get cup of tea.  
Try a solution.  
If that doesn’t work, try another one.  
Respond to message on facebook.  
Try solution again. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.     

Sometimes you'll luck out, but __the best way involves a) having a framework and b) _practicing_ it.__

## Framework
“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” _— V. Anton Spraul_

So, what should you do when you encounter a new challenge?


### 1) Be Intentional and Build a habit 
Be intentional about developing habits that will grow you as a learner and as a programmer. 

During the [Prep curriculum](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/student-prep/blob/master/prep-curriculum/README.md) you will have spent sometime exploring this domain.
If you haven't, we recommend doing so. 


At the beginning of each day: 
- __Ask yourself 'The Two Questions'__ and write them down:
    - __(1) What are my goals today?__ E.g. "Complete JavaScript blog challenge" or "Spend 4 hours coding"
    - __(2) What are my challenges today?__ E.g. "To keep to the timeBox suggestions" or "To back myself and not criticize myself" 
- __Commit to Focus:__
    - Assess your focus 
    - Eliminate distractions 
    - Practice attention training (mindfulness 2 minutes - you'll learn more about this as you progress through the course)
    - Focus on one thing at a time
    - Live in the moment 
    - Apply the principal of "Just in time" learning (don't try to learn it all)
    - Plan to take short breaks
    

### 2) Understand   
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

__How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.__
__If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.”__ _Richard Feynman_>_

Write down the problem in plain english, doodle a diagram, or tell someone or something about it. Some people use [Rubber Ducky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huOPVqztPdc)   


### 3) Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

__Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.__

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”


### 4) Divide
The most important step of all! Do not try to solve one big problem!

__Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.__

“If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.

For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.

If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?
Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul

Break the problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). Then connect the dots, connecting all your sub-solutions will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

### 5) Make an attempt at solving it 
Piece it together and start solving the code.

### 6) Stuck?
First off, take a deep breath.

A key indicator of a Programmer's mindset is how they respond to bugs and errors. Are you feeling curious or irritated? Remember that errors and bugs are conducive to your development. Adopt a 'not yet' attitude and go in with curiosity. 

Here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

__Debug:__ Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

__Reassess:__ Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?  

__Research:__ Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions)

__Caveat:__ Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

### 7) Refactor 
Refactoring is not about solving the problem differently, it's about solving the problem well. 

Good solutions don't just work, they are clear.

For more info see the [refactor resource](refactor.md)

### 8) Reflect 
There is an increasing amount of evidence that within the learning domain, reflection is a the most important aspect of learning. However you learn best — visually, auditory, or kinesthetically — you'll reap the most rewards by spending time reflecting on your experiences

__Ask yourself The Two (end of day) Questions__ 
- __(1) Have I reached my goals for today?__
If yes, take a moment to enjoy the fact that you reached it and ask yourself what you've done good today to reach your goals. If not, ask yourself what you can do better the next day to make sure you reach your goals. If you fail to reach your daily goals day by day, try different ways of working to improve it. Don't give up. If you reach your daily goals day by day, try giving yourself more ambitious goals and look what's happening.

- __(2) What have I learned today?__ Take a moment every day, to ask yourself what you've learned today. 


### 9) Practice  
Don’t expect to be great after just one sprint. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”

## Conclusion 
Problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill). When engaging with learning, use the process and framework and weave it into your habit.
