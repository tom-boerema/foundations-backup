# Course outline - Getting started 
Tēnā koutou and Welcome to day 1 of your learning journey! This primer is to introduce you to the format of Foundations. 

For full details, please see the student handbook. 


## Learning Competencies
By the end of this primer, you should have an understanding of:

<br>

Key Summary  | 
------------|
- Foundations is made of 5 sprints (a sprint is a block of work)
- Completion of activities due 10pm Sunday at end of sprint 
- Length of sprint depends on student status (full time vs part time) 
- Check-in with Facilitator required each sprint
- Curriculum delivered via GitHub, with set of activities to complete
- Activities take the form of primers and challenges, each with recommended time allotment
- Assessments are designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively
- Students have agency over their own learning  



## Timebox 

Activity | Time|
------------|----------|
Read primer | 20 minutes |

Each primer, challenge or activity begins with the recommended amount of time to spend completing the activity. There will always be more to learn than time available, so managing your time well is a key to success.  

For example, this primer should take you 20 minutes.

Keep a track of your time by committing to calendar scheduling and/or use tools like toggl, pomodoro or a timer on your device. This is a skill you'll want to develop if ever you want to work remotely in your career or on code projects. 

The prep-curriculum included a primer on supporting you to develop good time management and productivity. If you haven't completed the activity we suggest you do.

## Sprints 
A sprint is a term from the Agile software development method, that typically means "a predetermined timeframe within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog."

In foundations we use the term 'sprint' to define a block of work. There are 5 sprints of work. How long a sprint takes will depend on if you are full-time or part-time, i.e. the length of time you selected to study during your enrollment. 

Study | Length of Sprint | Hours per Sprint | Length of Foundations |  
------------|----------|------------|--------|
Full-time (FT) | 1 Week  | 36-40 hours | 5 weeks | 
Part-time (PT) | 2 Weeks | 18-20 hours | 10 weeks |


## Full-time vs Part-time 
There are variances in full-time and part-time delivery, but regardless of your status, the same rule for coding applies: 

__Code Every Day!__

Research shows that learning is quicker if you engage everyday and avoid periods of dormancy. For example, if you've taken 2 days out from coding, the time to reorientate will be longer, than if you had spent 15 minutes coding on each of those days. Reflect on what you know about the neuroplasticity of the brain - each time you practice, you are strengthening the neural pathways of your brain, and in effect improving your skill levels.  

### Full-time:  
Foundations is like a full-time job. It requires about 8 hours a day of your focus and effort. If you miss a day, you'll need to play catch-up. 

You'll meet your part-time cohort who will begin to integrate and sync in as Foundations progresses. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and Student-teaching-student attitude, as it strengthens everyone's learning. Lean on each other and learn together.   

Students will have access to an online recorded tech workshop at the beginning of each sprint and a 1:1 check-in with their facilitator during the sprint. 

### Part-time:
Depending on the number of folk studying part-time, you could be flying completely solo, or together with a few others. PT students will have a 1:1 check-in session with their facilitator during each sprint.

Six weeks before Bootcamp, the rest of your cohort will join Foundations. During this time, you'll be encouraged to sync in and participate with them. We encourage Tuakana/Teina and student-teaching-student attitude, as it benefits everyone's learning.


## Schedule 
Each sprint includes a check-in with your facilitator.


FT | PT |
------------|----------|
Students have 1 week to complete each sprint| Students have 2 weeks to complete each sprint |
40 hours of study per week | 20 hours of study per week |
Students need to have their sprint completed and ready for review by 10pm on the Sunday of every week | Students need to have their sprint completed and ready for review by 10pm on the Sunday of the 2nd week of each sprint |



## Content delivery 
Course material is delivered via GitHub, the platform you are currently using to view this material. 
Your facilitator will journey with you through this content to support your growth and skill development.

__Course content delivered via GitHub and supported by facilitator__

## Engaging with the material
Each sprint will have a list of activities to complete. Some of these will be 'primers' - introducing to the context to get you going. Others will be 'challenges' which require you to complete a set of tasks. And some activities will be a combination of both. Some sprints include additional stretch material for those with the time who want to dive deeper. 

Activities are in sequential order. 

__Complete all activities, in sequential order.__  
__Optional stretch material available in some sprints__

## Submitting work and Feedback
At the completion of a sprint, you will need to fill out a feedback form. Your feedback influences design and content improvements, as has that from hundreds of students gone before. In addition to feedback being part of our continual improvement framework, it help us to support you and your development and may at times inform your 1:1 sessions. 

__Submit sprintly feedback form by 10pm Sunday to signal completion of work.__ 

## Extensions 
All students, regardless of FT or PT status are required to submit work at the end of the sprint by 10pm Sunday. If you are unable to complete the material by the end of the sprint, you must let your facilitaor know before 5pm on Friday.

__Extension requests are necessary even for PT__

## Assessments 
The curriculum is not designed to teach people how to pass tests. Instead we aim to teach people to build useful applications. Assessment are still important so that students and teachers can evaluate progress. But the assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during your learning experience.

Passing is not the same as working code - we take into consideration your engagement, your skill development in process and provide opportunities for you demonstrate your knowledge. Assessments are not about making the code work, although, working code is ideal!  

__Assessments are not about working code__

## Model of Education and Flipped learning. 
For a more thorough explanation, see the 'EDA way' primer in the [prep curriculum](https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/student-prep/blob/master/prep-curriculum/core-approach-to-learning.md)

__Skills over Knowledge__  
The curriculum prioritises growing skills over knowledge.

__Unobtrusive assessment__  
Assessment is designed to be harvested continuously and unobtrusively during your learning experience.

__Flipped classrooms__  
Self determination and agency over your own learning is a key to success. Your facilitators become your peers, who are there to support you to develop your own agency and self determination. 

__Just in time learning__  
Instead of delivering a large amount of basic content upfront give you just enough to achieve a challenge. This differs from the ‘just in case’ philosophy of many educators where students learn a lot of things they will rarely or never use in practice.
