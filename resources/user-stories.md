# User Stories
User stories are informal, natural language descriptions of one or more features. They are typically written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system and facilitate sensemaking and communication. Their purpose is to help software teams organise their understanding of the system and its context. 

User stories are usually small, each line representing a single story. For example: 

    Students can purchase monthly parking passes online.  
    Parking passes can be paid via credit cards.  
    Parking passes can be paid via PayPal.  
    Professors can input student marks.  
    Students can obtain their current seminar schedule.  
    Students can order official transcripts.  
    Students can only enroll in seminars for which they have prerequisites.  
    Transcripts will be available online via a standard browser.
