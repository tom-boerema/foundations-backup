# Problem Solving and Pseudocode

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this primer, you should be familiar with and able to explain:

- Why problem solving is an important skill to have as a developer.
- A variety of problem solving techniques you can start using today (starting with pseudocode).

## Summary
As a developer, before you even start to code you need to make the time to think of ways you might approach a problem you are trying solve. You'll need to learn to look at problems, look at the information you have and figure out how are you going to get to where you want to be. You will need to learn how to take a problem, break it down into smaller parts, and begin building your way towards a solution.

Throughout your journey in Web Development, you are going to be confronted with a range of problems you need to solve.  It is important you are equipped with the skills you will need to approach these problems.


## Timebox 

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Research | 30 minutes
Practice | 1.5 hours
Reflect | 30 minutes

## Problem Solving 
Problem solving is a key skill you will utilise as a developer. Here are some problem solving techniques you can try today: 
- Pseudocode
- The rubber ducky method
- Reading error messages
- Console.logging
- Googling
- Trying something
- Asking your peers for help
- Asking coaches for help
- Improving your process with reflection

## Pseudocode

Many of the techniques mentioned above can be applied to all sorts of (non-technical) problems, but pseudocode is coding specific and incredibly useful to help you think through your code.

Pseudocode is not actual code, but rather comments that tell you how the code will eventually look. It is informal, plainly written steps that form the rough draft or outline of your code. 

Pseudocoding involves taking a little time before you get into writing the code to break down your plan into small steps. This means you don't have to worry about making the whole thing work at once, but can instead focus on just coding one step at a time. This can be useful for helping you break down a complicated problem, but can also be used if one developer needs to leave instructions for another to complete the code later.

Because pseudocode is the steps rather than the code itself, you don't need to include the fine details of what needs to happen. It's a bit like recalling a recipe you know, you don't need all the details immediately, you just need to know the ingredients needed and can work the rest out when you get to it. For example, to make brownies:
```
// put butter, sugar, and cocoa in bowl and then microwave
// add eggs and vanilla and mix through
// add flour and mix until thick
// bake!
```
You can see that we didn't include any details, just general steps.

Once you have written pseudocode, you may find you need to change the order of steps, or you might discover that you have forgotten some and need to add them in - and that's okay! This is only a first draft and it will inevitably change as you come to write the code itself.

## Research 
From the list of problem solving techniques (above), if there are any techniques you have never heard of before - take 30 minutes to research these.
Keep notes as you'll describe problem solving in your technical blog this sprint. 

## Reflect
In your `my-reflections-sprint-4` file, answer the questions under the heading `Problem Solving and Pseudocode`.
