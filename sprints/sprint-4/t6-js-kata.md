# Kata

## Summary
For this challenge you will be completing a number of different kata exercises on [repl.it](t4-repl-intro.md) to practice your JavaScript. 

Each of these kata will involve you completing some code to pass tests that have already been written for you. These will all be presented slightly differently and focus on different parts of JavaScript, so make sure you take your time to read the accompanying file and get yourself familiar with the kata before starting.

## Timebox

Activity | Time|
------------|----------|
Kata | 22 hours
Stretch | 8 hours


## Description
The concept of kata are taken from [martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata), small, repetitive tasks used to improve your form. We use kata in coding as small challenges that we can do again and again to use different techniques, different pieces of code, to try and solve the same problem in different ways.

This will be your first time encountering these kata, so don't expect that you will do them quickly. Each time you redo them you will have the experience from last time, so when coming back to these your time will decrease with each go.

Once our basic kata have been mastered the next step is placing some restrictions on how you complete them. You will have a number of different ways to complete the same kata, so a restriction on how you do it can help you master your form in one particular area.

## Get Coding!
You will need to work through the kata in the order given below as they will build on JavaScript from earlier kata.
