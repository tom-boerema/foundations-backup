## Summary
In this challenge you will be using some of the built-in methods for arrays and strings. A built-in method is another name for a function that is already written for you and available in the basic JavaScript library, you just need to know how to use it!

Each function waiting to be written focuses on a different array method. You will need to research the methods you will use for each of these functions so you can make the tests pass.

The MDN documentation can be a great place to start, as it lists __all__ the built-in methods available for both [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), but you will want to find your own resources about these methods to help you complete your functions.

Making sure you are logged in to your account, navigate to the [Built-in Methods](https://repl.it/@devacademy/Built-in-Methods) challenge. Starting the challenge will then fork it to your own account.

## Get Coding
For this challenge, you will find the code we need to complete isn't in our main index.js file. This file contains the code that tells your tests to run. You will instead need to complete the empty functions held within the `functions.js` file. 

You will need to use built-in array and string functions to get the tests passing. The tests will give you some feedback on what they expected to have received from your function and what they actually received to help you complete the code and pass the tests.

These are the functions you will need to complete:

#### concatMyArray
In this first function we will take an array of individual strings and then `join` them together to return the complete word.

#### capitalize
We need to `map` over every word in a given sentence and Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word.

#### whereAreYou    
This function will require you to `find` the door number that Scooby is hiding behind. You may want to use `console.log` or the tests in the `functions.test.js` file to help you solve this one.

#### deBee
To get rid of the bees in this string you will need to `split` the string into individual words before `filtering` out all those annoying buzzing sounds!
