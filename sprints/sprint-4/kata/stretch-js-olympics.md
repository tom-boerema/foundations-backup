## Summary
It is finally time... for the Foundations JavaScript Olympics! You will be completing a pentathlon of challenges to stretch your JavaScript knowledge. You will be going through a variety of tasks, some of them you will know how to do already, some will test your research abilities, but all of our events today will require you to read the tests to work out why they are failing and make them pass.

## [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@devacademy)
Making sure you are logged into your account, navigate to the [JS Olympics](https://repl.it/@devacademy/JS-Olympics) challenge. Starting the challenge will then fork it to your own account.



## EVENT 0 - The Warm up
Create athlete profiles for you and someone else you know and them add them to the athleteArray. Each profile should have a name, age, sport, and quote. You should use object literal notation for this exercise. Run the tests to make sure your properties are defined properly. 

## EVENT 1 - Bulk up
#### Add properties to objects
Use a `for` loop to add a property called `win` to every element in athleteArray. `win` should be a `function expression` that console logs: "{name} won the {sport} event!"

## EVENT 2 - !sdrow ruoy elbmuJ
#### Reverse a string
Create a function called `unjumble` that accepts a string as an argument and reverses it.

Use the built-in JavaScript methods for strings and arrays to accomplish this. See the MDN [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) and [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) documentation for all the available methods.

## EVENT 3 - 2, 4, 6 ,8! Who do we appreciate?
#### Remove odd numbers from an array
Create a function called `removeOdds` that accepts an array of numbers. Return an array with only the even numbers.

You can do this manually or use built-in JavaScript [Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).


## EVENT 4 - "We Built this City"
#### Build a constructor function
Create a function called `newAthlete` that takes a name, age, sport, and quote and creates a new athlete object from it.


## Reflection
