# Play with JavaScript

One of the habits for this sprint has been to create and share. And now that you've finished the content of this final sprint, it's time to have some fun.

Create something with JavaScript that has no purpose other than to be beautiful or interesting in some way.\
An example of such a pointless project: [Magic02](https://richchurcher.github.io/magic02.html) (***WARNING: TURN THE VOLUME DOWN IF IN A PUBLIC PLACE!***)

You have no limitations on what you use except this: you must make the project freely available on your GitHub, and advertise it in the #show-eda channel.

 
1. Create an art project or something fun in JavaScript. No limits: just use JS and deploy it to your github.io site using GitHub Pages as you've done in previous assignments.

2. Add a LICENSE file by going to GitHub, navigating to your project's repository and clicking the 'Create New File' button. In the input box that appears, type the word 'LICENSE'. To the right you'll see a dropdown named 'Choose a license'. You can select different ones to see what they contain. (If you're not sure, the Apache License 2.0 is a pretty good all-round choice.) When you're done, click 'Commit new file'.

3. Share a link to your project in the #show-eda Slack channel. Mention that it's released under an open source license (and say which one). Invite anyone to submit pull requests if they would like to contribute!

4. Check out the rest of the submissions to #show-eda (some of them will be from other cohorts.) Can you help any of them, or add features? Submit a PR!
