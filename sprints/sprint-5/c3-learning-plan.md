# Learning Plans - Preparing for Bootcamp     

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this challenge, you should have a clear understanding of your goals and objectives for Bootcamp.

## Summary
Your Learning Plan describes how you will operate within the context of Foundations and Bootcamp at Dev Academy. It has been a tool used between you and your facilitator as a Kaupapa for your individual learning. 

The goal for us in Foundations has always been to ensure we have prepared you as best as we possibly can for Bootcamp.  By now, you are used to the flow and structure of Foundations and things will change in Bootcamp.

To ensure you are set up to continue evolving your Learning Plan, in this challenge we will be working to prepare you and your Learning Plan for the next part of your Dev Academy journey - Bootcamp.

## Reassess your Learning Plan

The pressures and challenges of Bootcamp will be different to those in Foundations, as well as the type of help and support available to you. 

We will revisit similar questions to those that you answered when first formulating your Learning Plan, but now with a particular focus on learning goals and objectives while on Bootcamp. 

Take some time to reflect on these questions and record your answers in a document. We will then be adding this information to your Learning Plan blog page from Sprint 2. 

### Consider the following and answer the questions in bold:

-  **What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?**

    What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
    
- **What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations  will be in Bootcamp?** 

    Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?

- **What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?**

    While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.

- **What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?**

    At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?

    For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.

- **What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?**

    What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.

- **What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp**

    Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?

    Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.

## Update your Learning Plan blog

These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list, though all parts should be answered. You should bring them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated and can include any other information you feel may be relevant.

Create a new section on your `sprint2-cultural` blog, where you recorded your Foundations Learning Plan, above the previous plan. This is where your Bootcamp Learning Plan will go.

Update this page with your new Learning Plan for Bootcamp, and make sure those changes go live on your blog!
