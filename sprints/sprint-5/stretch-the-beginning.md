# The end... of the beginning

Congratulations! You've now finished all of the material for Foundations. There's still a lot of revision you can do before your bootcamp start date!

- Revise material from the `Competency Checklist`. Navigate to the reflections folder and open the `foundations-competency-checklist.md` file to see the list.

- Revise past sprints (we recommend sprints 3 & 4)

- Pair or Mentor with other students going through Foundations. You don't really know something until you can teach it!

- Try more JavaScript kata! Keep practising :)
    - [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) is a site full of kata of all different levels and languages. Join up with team Enspiral Dev Academy to find some other folks making their way through the challenges too. It is a great one to use to keep sharpening those skills before you start bootcamp, but do beware, the difficulty can ramp up pretty quickly so don't get disheartened if you find it challenging

    - If you're in a more festive mood, the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) releases a new challenge every day in December. However if it's not that time of year but you'd still like to give it a go, you can find their previous challenges on the [events](https://adventofcode.com/events) page of their website

- Make more personal projects! Rebuild your blog! The possibilities are endless!

We'll see you in bootcamp!
