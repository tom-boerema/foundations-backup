# Preparing for Bootcamp  

## Setting your expectations for Bootcamp
It can feel quite disruptive moving from one phase of a course to another.  In this case, you are moving from Foundations to commence your 9 week intensive web development Bootcamp. There are differences in how things are run in Bootcamp compared to what you are used to in Foundations. Let's look at what you can expect once you hit Bootcamp:

- __Weekly check-in's with your Human Skills (Core) facilitators.__

Every second week of Bootcamp you will have 1:1 time with your Human Skills facilitators. This isn't a time to address technical queries, it is the time for us to support you and your emotional well being throughout Bootcamp.

In Auckland, your Human Skills facilitator is Dougal Stott. In Wellington, your Human Skills facilitator is Ming Jansen.  We also have our Human Skills Lead Sarrah Jayne who assists across campuses and is based in Wellington. You will have the chance to meet them on day 1 of Bootcamp.

- __End of Phase Tech-ins with your Teacher/s.__

In Bootcamp there will be three phases. Each of them 3 weeks long. 

| Weeks | Phase | - |
|---|---|---|
| 1 - 3 | One | JavaScript and Web Basics |
| 4 - 6 | Two | Modern FullStack Development |
| 7 - 9 | Three | The Final Phase |


At the end of each Phase you will have a Tech-in with your teacher/s.  This will be 1:1 time where your teachers will be able to provide you with feedback on your technical progress and address any technical concerns you may have. Keep in mind you can ask for these at any point of the course.

Your success in Bootcamp depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a learner. It also relies on your ability to bring your whole self and work alongside others kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face).

This change in your learning environment will bring it's own benefits and challenges - it is a great opportunity for you to learn and grow with deliberate intention and your Learning Plan will be a tool to help you achieve this.

## Keep evolving your Learning Plans throughout Bootcamp

Now that you have an idea of when planned 1:1 times are throughout Bootcamp you can begin to build habits in your week to evolve your Learning Plans. A suggestion is:

Book in 20 minutes at the start or end of each week for you to reflect on your learning plan and your learning journey in Bootcamp. Update your learning plan with the relevant information or remove any information that is no longer relevant.

- Have you noticed your strengths in practice?  
- Had any setbacks or challenges that week? What did you do to overcome these?
- What will you differently next time?  
- What was a highlight for you? 

We'll look at Learning plans a bit more in depth in the next exercise.
