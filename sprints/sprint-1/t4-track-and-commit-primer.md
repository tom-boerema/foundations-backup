# Track and Commit Primer!

## Learning Competencies

- Define "commit"
- Demonstrate best practices for commit messages
- Describe the three states of a file in git (working, staged, commit)

## Summary

Git works by following all of the changes in the files inside a git tracked folder. The save point in git is called a commit. Think of a commit like a checkpoint in a video game. It is a point where you can go back to and look at the state of the files at that commit. Just like in a video game if make the wrong decision, you can go back to the checkpoint. A commit is your safety net if you accidentally introduce bugs in your code. You can revert to a working state while you debug your code. It is a great idea to commit often to create more frequent save points to fall back on.

__Your git Commit history is visible to us and we use it to assess your participation and engagement. Throughout the course we'll be looking at the frequency and consistency. So engage daily and commit often. That means when ever you add something that works, remove something, or fix something, commit it.__

## Good Commit Messages 
Because commits are 'save points', it is important to write good commit messages so you (and others) know what each commit includes.

We ask that you follow [GitHub's convention](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) and use (imperative) for your commits. E.g Use "Make dog bark" (imperative) instead of "Makes dog bark" or "Made the dog bark"


## Reflect
Open your reflections text file and answer:

- How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
