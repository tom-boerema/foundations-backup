## Summary
A lot of people think that web development is about writing code. But actually web development is about solving problems and learning to think in a specific kind of way.

__“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.”__ _— Steve Jobs_

Thinking like a web developers requires you to develop your problem solving skills. Its a practice that involves understanding the problem, planning your approach and knowing how to get answers. 

Our role is to help you along that path and encourage you to seek what you need to solve the problem. As such, we give you a framework of reference including learning objectives, and mentorship to help you self solve. This type of learning can be uncomfortable at first, especially if you are use to step by step instructions. But this way, you will learn quicker than you ever thought possible. Welcome to the World of Web Development!

__“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.__  

Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design. __Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.__” _— Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)_
