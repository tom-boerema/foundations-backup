# Identity, Values and Strengths Activity 

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to:
- Describe personal values and ethics 
- Describe your strengths 
 

## Summary
Who you are and what you bring shapes your learning journey. In a flipped classroom context, you are responsible for your journey and it's also important to understand what every person is bringing.  This exploration requires you to examine and reflect on your identity, and start to articulate whatâ€™s at the core of who you are. You will examine your values, ethics, strengths and limitations, what has shaped these, and where you could do some learning that is beneficial to your growth. 

This will form the basis of establishing your Learning Agreement. 


## Timebox

Activity | Time|
------------|----------|
Gather evidence | 1-2 hours
Document it  | 2 hours |


Follow the timebox suggestions. We know its exciting to learn, but trust us, be wise on how deep you go. Let the learning competencies be your guide. Ask yourself if you know them.


## Gather Evidence 
1. Gather evidence to identify what your personal values are.
The reflection gets you to examine and identify who you are at this point, this involves a self-evaluation and seeking feedback from two or three trusted friends, family, whanau, colleagues. This allows you to compare how you see yourself, with how others see you.

Evidence might include: stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice; a testimonial/feedback from someone; an achievement you are proud of; using a tool to help you surface and name the values most important to you; visuals or narratives that help you describe where your values came from; whakatauki or quotes that sum up your values; your review of learning

2. Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development.
Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples. 


## Document it 
Next sprint, you will publish this document as a blog post which will be visible to your cohort and facilitator. Your blog participation counts towards your overall assessment. Until then, write your findings on a temporary document (word, google docs, text edit etc).

1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.  

    - Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. 
    - Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. 

2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.

    - Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. 
    - Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. 
    - Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development  
    - Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.  
    - Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
