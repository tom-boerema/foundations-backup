# Version Control with Git - Primer

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to 

- Explain what version control is and does  
- Understand what Git is 
- Understand what GitHub is

## Summary 

Version Control allows groups of people to work together on the same code, at the same time, without overwriting each others work. It is not a programming language like JavaScript, or Ruby, or C#. It is software that you download - a form of 'distributed version control' which means it manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of the project.

## Timebox

Follow the timebox suggestions. This is a primer only and there is a deep dive challenge next to start applying this knowledge. Let the learning competencies be your guide.

## Description 

Version control enables Web Developers to collaborate without over writing each others work, and provides an entire history of changes. 

__The most widely used Version Control Software is called Git__

Git doesn't require any remote servers for its operation (it can simply be installed on your computer), but for easy access and collaboration, web developers use GitHub (the largest code host on the planet) for storing and sharing code.

__GitHub is a company that provides file hosting online.__ 

With over 10 million users, GitHub has become a social network for web developers - much like facebook or twitter. You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by following their accounts. And while many users store programs and code projects, thereâ€™s nothing preventing you from keeping text documents or other file types in your project folders to show off.

__So to conclude, Git is a (software) tool that you download and GitHub is a service that you sign up to.__

Almost all of your learning material will use Git, and almost all of it will be distributed via GitHub.

## Reflect
On a text document, record your reflections. You'll transfer these reflections to a git file in a later challenge.  

__In your reflection answer the questions:__
- Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
- Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
- Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
- Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
