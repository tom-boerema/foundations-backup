# Command Line Primer (aka Terminal, Shell, Prompt)

### Learning Competencies
By the end of this exploration, you should be able to do the following in/using the command line:
- Identify your location
- Navigate between directories
- Create new and delete existing directories and files
- Open files


## Summary
Programmers do not always have pretty ways to interface or test their code. Most spend a good deal of time in their command line - "a tool where you can use text commands to perform specific tasks." When you use the command line, you don't slow yourself down opening a finder and double-clicking on folders. Instead, you get to navigate around your computer, open, create, delete, move, files, etc. all using commands. It's quick, efficient, and easy once you get the hang of it.

Knowing how to use your command line will be vital to your success as a programmer. Fortunately for now you only need to know a few commands.

## Timebox

Activity | Time|
------------|----------|
See it in action | 15 minutes |
Give it a try | 20 minutes
Explore a little | 20 minutes |
Reflect | 15 minutes |

Follow the timebox suggestions. We know its exciting to learn, but trust us, be wise on how deep you go. Let the learning competencies be your guide. Ask yourself if you know them.


## Introduction 
The purpose of this primer is to introduce you to the command line tool. If you're already familiar with it, check your knowledge against the learning competencies. If you are, you can jump straight into the Reflection exercise and or try the stretch competencies. 

Mac, Windows and Linux each come with an inbuilt command line tool, however during prep you installed an alternative (iTerm2 or Git for Windows).

You can use either the inbuilt tool or the recommended tool during this exploration. The commands and inputs are interchangeable, with only a few occasional variations for Windows. So, if you're following online tutorials, just switch out "git for windows" when the tutorial says "powershell". 

Operating System | Inbuilt tool | Recommended tool |  
------------|----------|----------| 
Mac | terminal | iTerm2  
Windows | cmd and/or powershell | git for windows/gitbash  
Linux | gnome | gnome |

## Give it a try
Follow this [useful guide](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html) to try it out. Don't be put off by the "learn python" reference. Notice the difference between windows, Linux and mac.

## Explore a little more 
Have a look for some learning resources: Videos, tutorials, Google. Try key words like 'Terminal', 'Command Line Basic' and 'cheatsheet'. Have you achieved the learning competencies? 

## Reflect
Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and will help to demonstrate your knowledge of the learning outcomes.

Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience. They should be only a paragraph long.

Keep note of where you keep your reflection as you'll be asked to use them in a later task. If you like, try using your new command line skills to create a directory and/or file for your reflections.

__In your reflection file answer the questions:__
- In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
- Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
- Name 5 commands you used and what they do.
- Did you learn anything unexpected?


## Stretch Competencies
Come back to stretch competencies in your spare time. Stretch material is useful, but isn't necessary to move forward. Don't focus on them now while you're getting started, but come back to them when you have spare time.

- Remove or copy a directory  
- Stream a file  
- Find and look inside files  
- Get help
