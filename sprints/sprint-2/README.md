# Sprint Two

In the first part this Sprint you'll dive into HTML and CSS, the language of the web, and use it to create a blog that you'll contribute to through out your journey. Secondly you'll use last sprints core material and reflections to pull together your learning plan. You'll need to arrange a time to pair with an EDA facilitator to establish to negotiate that plan.

Start by watching the [Sprint 2 Intro Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6j-ngnQe7M) on Youtube!
