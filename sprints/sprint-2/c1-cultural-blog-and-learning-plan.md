# My Learning Plan

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, you should have

- Formulated your Learning Plan
- Published your Learning Plan as a personal blog

### Summary

This programme is not a traditional programme. It depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a learner. This leads to a more individualised experience and increased learning skills moving forward. To facilitate this everyone will have a Learning Plan. This learning plan will be negotiated between you and a facilitator. It will include setting your learning targets based on the course learning outcomes, what you expect to do to meet your targets, and what the facilitator is expected to do. This plan is a core part of your learning and will develop your skills to set and achieve target in the future. We fully expect this plan to develop as you become more aware of how you work and learn.

### Description 

The learning plan describes how you will operate within the context of the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp Program. It will be negotiated with peers and facilitators as a Kaupapa for your individual learning. You'll use last sprint's exploration of values, identity and strengths to describe the motivations and values you are bringing into your learning experience. 

## Participation
Your success in this programme depends on your full commitment to doing what you say you will do. The bottom line is that if you say what, how and when you will do something, everyone working with you will expect it delivered as promised. Anything different should be negotiated in a timely and professional manner to alter those expectations.

There are three aspects of participation that you should think about specifically addressing in that plan:
- it is difficult to develop a supportive community of learners if you are not fully taking part in that community  
- our whole approach to learning from each other as equals, is hard to do if we are not all there. Staff then have to take on the role of trying to “chase” learners to participate  

- our resources are unnecessarily stretched and not focussed on productive work if staff are sitting waiting for a 1:1 and no one shows up, we could have been working on course development that would help everyone.  

- What will you do when things are building up and starting to get to you.  


## Formulate Learning Plan
Time to formulate your Learning Plan! Write your findings on a temporary document (word, google docs, text edit etc).
The Learning Plan needs to include the following elements:  

- What is your long term goal and or career pathway?   
- What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?	 	 
- A description of your own strengths and limitations 
- Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
- A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
- A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
- Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
- For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
- These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.

You and your facilitator will discuss your learning plan in the next check-in

## Publish Core Blogs (x2) 

In this exercise you will publish 2 core blog posts - last sprints [Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration](/sprints/sprint-1/c3-identity-and-values.md) (c1-blog) and this sprints Learning Plan (c2-blog).  

Conduct these steps using terminal: 
1. Navigate __INTO__ `username.github.io/blog` directory
2. Create two files: `sprint1-cultural.html` and `sprint2-cultural.html`
3. Copy and paste [the template](/resources/html-template.html)
4. Update the css file `<link href="your-stylesheet-link-here.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`with `main.css`
5. In sprint1-cultural.html, copy and paste your __Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration__ 
6. In sprint2-cultural.html, copy and paste your __Learning Plan__ 
7. Stage, commit, push 
8. View your blogs on your web browser e.g. `http://username.github.io/blog/sprint1-cultural.html`
