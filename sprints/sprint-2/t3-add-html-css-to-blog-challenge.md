# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of the challenge, you should be able to:

- Set up a basic HTML page with the appropriate tags (html, head, title, etc.)  
- Add paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, and/or tables  
- Divide content on a page using divs and spans  
- Link an external stylesheet to an html document  
- Position elements using CSS  
- Modify element style (size, color, etc) using CSS  
- Compare and use classes and ids to manipulate elements  


## Summary
You learned a bunch of stuff in FreeCodeCamp and Udacity. Apply that knowledge to transform your index page into something 'you'. The index page is the 'homepage' of your blogs. You will need factor in where and how you will list your blog entries on your site.  

## Timebox

Activity | Time|
------------|----------|
Planning | 45 minutes 
Application | 6 hours
Reflection | 10 minutes

## Planning 
Ask yourself 
1. What is my site's primary purpose
2. Who is my audience (is it kids, adults, academics)
3. How will I build my site to support their user experience 
4. Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!
5. What other directories do I need (e.g images). Where do I put that directory?
6. Do I want the style to be applied to your blog entries also?  

## Application 
Go forth and beautify your index page. Include a link to your blog file/s. 

You want to do enough playing to get a good comprehension of the learning competencies, and ultimately feel good about your finished product - just be careful not to get lost down too deep in the rabbit holes!

Make sure you have ticked off each of the learning competencies. 


## Reflect 
Navigate to your `my-reflections-sprint-2` file and add your reflections from this challenge. The questions are under the heading `Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge` in that file.

Stage, commit, and push to github.
