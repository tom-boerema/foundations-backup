# Intro to CSS Frameworks (Stretch)

## Learning Competencies

- Understanding what CSS frameworks are
- A brief understanding of how to use the Bulma framework

## Summary

CSS frameworks provide basic CSS that you can import like a stylesheet in order to tackle common issues in front-end web development, such as getting divs to line up where you want them.

This way developers do not have to start from scratch every time they build an application. They can reuse the basic foundation from earlier applications and get straight into working on the crux of the website or application rather than coding in every little detail again and again for each application.

They can greatly decrease the time needed to start creating applications and websites.
