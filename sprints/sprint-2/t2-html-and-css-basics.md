# Learn HTML and CSS Challenge 

### Learning Competencies Part 1
By the end of the first part, you should:
- Selected a path to learn from and gain an understanding in: 
  - Basic HTML page with and tags (html, head, title,etc.)
  - Adding paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, tables  
  - Diving content on a page using divs and spans

### Learning Competencies Part 2
By the end of the second part, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply classes, id's  
- Navigate the DOM 
- Understand and use box design 
- Understand and create responsive design 
- Understand and use semantic structuring 


## Summary
We've selected a couple of choices for learning HTML and CSS. You'll need to create an account with FreeCodeCamp and  Udacity and give each a go. 

Udacity is media rich, with example files to practice with. 
FreeCodeCamp is practice rich and requires you to apply a little more problem solving. 

Try them both, get a sense for which resource suits your learning style better, and stick with that. Complete the recommended courses for either freecodecamp or Udacity.  

Always keep in mind the learning objectives. Ask yourself for example, "Can I navigate the DOM?". The courses should cover all the basics, but if you're still wondering "what is the DOM" then put your problem solving powers to good use and discover it. Frame the question well, reach out and have a discussion with someone in your cohort. Bring it up during a check in.

## Quick Primer 
[4 minute summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78) of what HTML, CSS and JavaScript are. 


__Pro-tip-1: You can adjust the speed of the video's in YouTube and Udacity to suit your learning pace__  
__Pro-tip-2: Stay focused, don't get lost in the details__  

## Preparing for surprises
Just like everything on the web, FreeCodeCamp and Udacity have their bugs. In some cases, your solution might be perfect, but FreeCodeCamp is throwing an error. It can take some patience to discern if the error is a bug or if its caused by your code. One of your tasks as budding web developer, is to query errors and recognise where the error is coming from.

Ask yourself - does it work in a different browser? Have other's encountered this error? 

## FreeCodeCamp + YouTube

FreeCodeCamp's interface can appear a little unfriendly to the untrained eye, but its methodology is solid. You'll be using the "Responsive web Design track". Pair it with demonstrations from YouTube to enhance your learning. 

__Instructions__
1. Sign up to freeCodeCamp using your GitHub login. 
2. As you complete each of the courses below search for YouTube content to supplement your learning. See example below
