## Why learn Emotional Intelligence?
The world is a changeable, complex, uncertain and ambiguous place. 

    Changeable: Change happens rapidly and on a large scale
    Uncertain: The future cannot be predicted with precision 
    Complex: Challenges are complicated by many factors
    Ambiguous: Little clarity on both problems and solutions

__And being human is tough..__ We've got all these complexities in life - pressures of work, pressures of being at EDA and learning a huge amount of stuff really quickly.. and we're human with complex minds and complex emotions! 

_So how can we work well in this complex world?_

## The Proposition:
Cultivating Emotional intelligence is one way of helping us in this complex world, helping us as we study at EDA and helping us work in the wider world. 

One definition of Emotional Intelligence is: 

> "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions”  Salovey and Mayer 1990


__There are three steps of Emotional Intelligence:__
1. Attention training 
2. Self knowledge and Mastery 
3. Creating Useful Mental Habits 



## Three steps of Emotional Intelligence:

### 1. Attention Training 
Paying attention to whats going on in the body leads to more understanding of emotion. The body is the easiest way for most people to access their emotions. 

We can train our attention to pay more and more close awareness to the mind, body and emotions. This training cultivates a clear, calm and alert mind.

### 2. Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery 
With an attentive mind, we are able to see what's going on for us internally. We grow more knowledge of who we are, how we are and how we engaging in any particular situation. And from knowledge comes mastery e.g. "Oh I know what happens when I get angry - I know the intensity of it and how to regulate it" 

### 3. Creating Useful Mental Habits 
What would it be like if every time I had a negative, critical thought, for example "I can't do a difficult task" I could defend against it and see clearly both my strengths and my weaknesses? 

What would it be like if every time I walked into a room of people that I don't know, my immediate mental habit that came up was "Oh, I wish everyone well in this room"? 

We can train our minds to develop habits to defend against the super ego (the critical, judging mind) when it comes up. 



## Three Benefits to Increasing your EQ
You might be thinking, so what? I'm here to code - I'm not here for this woo-woo stuff however, developing your EQ will have major benefits to your ability to learn, perform and to get hired. 

Three main benefits of strengthening EQ:
1. Stellar Performance 
2. Outstanding Leadership 
3. Happiness 


### Stellar Performance 
Daniel Goldman, one of the 'founders of the era of Emotional Intelligence' sites studies that find emotional intelligence to be twice as important in one's work environment as IQ. And that the higher up the ladder you go, the more important it becomes - meaning that the differentiating factor among people who are at a reasonably high level at a company, is not IQ, but EQ. 

__What does Stellar Performance look like in the tech world?__  
Research shows there are 6 factors that distinguish top performers from average performers within the tech sector. Note how 4/6 factors pertain to EQ, not IQ.  

* Achievement drive and standards
* Influence
* _Conceptual Thinking_
* _Analytical Ability_
* Initiative
* Self-Confidence


### Outstanding Leadership 

> “For those in leadership positions, emotional intelligence skills account for close to 90 percent of what distinguishes outstanding leaders from those judged as average.” (Kemper 1999)<block quote>

Once you get up to the higher levels, its the emotional intelligence piece that really shows up, even in more formal workplaces like the Navy. 

### Happiness 
> “A deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind… not a mere pleasurable feeling, a fleeting emotion, or a mood, but an optimal state of being.” Matthieu Riard 

Can you bring to mind a time when you felt like you were in an optimal state of being? Where your mind was bright and clear, and there was a sense of capability? When you weren't being trashed by your internal judge or super ego? A sense of stability and grounding? Aware of one strengths and limitations? An optimal state of being! If we want one word for what we're aiming for here, its __"optimal"__. 

_How can we be in the world in an optimal way? At school, at home? What does it mean to be optimal?_

## How do we Cultivate Emotional Intelligence?
__Neuroplasticity:__ Previously it was thought that the brain were fairly static once we stopped growing. But what we know now is that what we think, what we do, and what we pay attention to changes the structure and function of the brain.

So in the same way that we can train the muscles in our body, we can train _and change_ our brain. 

__Emotional Intelligence is a collection of skills:__
Emotional Intelligence is not something you are born with. It is something that we learn. Some of us were fortunate enough to have people around us when we were kids who were fairly emotionally astute and we were able to learn from them. Those of us who weren't blessed with that or with varying degrees of it, can train in it. 

__Skills are trainable:__ As with any skill we can train our Emotional Intelligence skills. If you think you have low EQ, its not the end of the world - with a little discipline and practice you can improve your skills.  


## How do we train? 
We're going to introduce 3 practices: 

1. Attention training 
2. Conscious listening
3. Journaling 

### 1. Attention Training

> “Paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally”         Jon Kabat-Zinn

Another word for attention training is mindfulness. Mindfulness is a form of meditation.  


> “Meditation refers to a family of mental training practices that are designed to familiarize the practitioner with specific types of mental processes.” Brefczynski-Lewis, 2007

There are thousands of different meditations - all kinds of different types of traditions, like yoga have them. We're doing a specific type of meditation here - which is mindfulness meditation. Paying attention, on purpose, in particular way, in the present moment, non judgmentally. Which is both incredibly simple and incredibly challenging. 

For example: I'm going to pay attention to my breath. I'm going to be feeling the sensations of the body, on purpose, in a particular way, in the present moment. I'm going to be with the experience that is happening right now. It's fine to be thinking about the past and the future but I want to be able to do that at will. So if I want to focus on right now, I can train myself to focus right now. If I want to think about the future, I think about the future. But often our minds are just zipping all over the place. __What would it be to be able to cultivate the mind, so that when we are set a programming challenge we are able to focus with the mind attentive and focused on the problem, rather than after a couple of seconds, drifting off thinking "Oh I wonder about xyz"?__  

What would it be like to more and more cultivate a mind that is able to stay focused and attentive on the challenges we set at EDA, but also then able to pay attention to our own emotional internal life?

The key piece to this type of focused attention is to do so __non judgmentally__. That is to simply notice what you are experiencing, without criticisms or judgments or evaluations. But rather, to just notice. 

Say I'm paying attention and I notice there is anger. To notice it is good, but then I think "I shouldn't be feeling angry. Why am I feeling angry at Kahu? I'm a bad person for being angry, Kahu's a nice guy." In this instance I'm off, away from the experience. And Mindfulness or attention training is about being in the experience, at will. 


__Mindfulness (Attention Training)__   
There are two aspects to mindfulness / attention training  
1. Attention 
2. Meta Attention. 

Attention - paying attention to breathing sensations in the belly and Meta attention - being aware when the attention is somewhere else. Its fairly remarkable quality we have as humans, not just to be aware of something, but to witness ourselves being aware of it. 

With Meta attention we are able to see ourselves having emotions - so there is a separation between the experience of the emotion and being aware of the emotion. The term is derived from the work of developmental psychologist, John Flavell, who coined the term to describe a phenomenon where a person has cognition about cognition or, stated another way, thinking about thinking.

One of the great practices of mindfulness practice - we are allowing and training the mind to be calm and stable. And we all live in a complex world, heads have all sorts of complex thoughts - what would it be like at will to be able to access calmness and clarity? 

### 2. Conscious listening
Rather than pay attention to the breath as we do in mindfulness, we pay attention to what someone else is saying. 

__You listen to someone for a period of time, without speaking yourself. It is simple, but transformational.__ 

This skill that we're introducing can be incredibly useful - both in terms of the information one can receive when I'm not constantly trying to 'jump in' or trying to work out the next step and the other great thing is the other person is much more likely to feel met and much more likely to feel heard. Think "ok I'm just going to receive what you're telling me, what you're saying, how you're appearing". 

__Introducing Conscious (Mindful) Listening:__  
The way we introduce and practice mindful listening is through a listening and looping exercise, which we will practice throughout foundations and bootcamp. This sprint, you'll be asked to pair with someone in your cohort. 

The format is like this 

- Object of attention is the other person  
- In Pairs  
- Person A describes... for 2 mins  
- Person B Mindfully listens  
- In silence (can nod and smile etc)  
- Person B loops back for 2 mins  

__Looping:__   
After Person A has finished speaking, Person B loops back what they heard Person A say. In one sense its a way of checking out whether I actually heard what this person said. Another piece of it is to clarify and come to an agreement. 

The important part is that Person B is repeating what they heard. Not your advice, not your recognition. But simply what you heard Person A say. 

If, when hearing it looped back, Person A is like "oh actually, I want to add something or change something", then person A can offer clarifications. Person B then loops back those clarifications until both parties are in agreement between that what was said was accurately heard.  

Keep in mind - it's not a competition to see what you can and can't remember. Its more to see if you can get the gist of what was going on and the quality of what the experience was like. 

__The two forms of Looping:__   
1. What I heard you say was .. 
2. What I heard you feel was .. 

In some instance's its good to practice "What I head you feel was..." Its not very good english, but it's trying to give some encouragement not to just tell the content of the story, but to kind of read between the lines of what was going on. What is the subtext of their feelings?  

For the most part of foundations, we'll focus on the first loop "What I heard you say.."

### 3. Journaling
There has been a lot of research over a 50 year period of the impact of writing down one's 'what ever'. 

During foundations, we use reflections in place of journaling, as the two service a similar function. 
As your learning journey continues through to bootcamp, we'll be introducing journaling as basically a brain dump. So you start writing for a prompt and you don't stop. 

__Journaling is:__
* Brain Dump 
* Self discovery 
* Not public 

__Journal Prompts:__
* What I'm feeling right now is..    
* When I feel understood I..  
* What I really care about is.. 

__The rule is don't stop!__ 

So if you run out of things to say you just write "I've run out of things to say - I don't know what to say.. this is really boring.. I hate it when I'm bored". What ever comes. Overtime, you'll find cognitions and emotions become easier to identify and to write about. And through writing about them, writers are able to develop greater awareness of the positive benefits of the stressful events. 

By taking our emotional life and verbalising it using different area's of the brain - the language centers of the brain and the self area's of the brain. 

>The foremost reason (of journaling) is disclosure. Psychologists are basically in agreement that avoiding or inhibiting unpleasant emotions or suppressing your thoughts makes makes your body tense, your mood negative, and your cognition impaired. But if you access, express, and process those blocked-up emotions, you’ll feel better, in all of the ways. For the same reason that talking about your breakup with your best friend makes you feel better, journaling about getting fired lets you process it.



## Core tasks 

1. __Research EQ and IQ__ - Keep your answers on a document which you will later turn into a blog post. 

    - What is Emotional Intelligence?  
    - How is it different to IQ?
    - Why is it important?  


2. __Practice focusing your attention and commit it to habit__. - We're going to ask you to use this form of training every day. 

    - Go to [HeadSpace.com.](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app)
    - __Sign up for a free account.__ 
    The prompts will shape your experience today and inform your future habit. We recommend choosing a time that you can repeat each day (e.g. After breakfast) __AS WELL AS__ at the beginning of every engagement with the EDA curriculum and experience.
    - __Practice.__ Using the web app or the mobile app, take time now to engage with the practice.  
    - __Set your intention.__ You're on a learning journey with us, just as countless others have gone before you. This means we've had a fair amount of experience seeing what has significant impacts on our student's ability to respond, grow and learn in this challenging environment.. so lean in and trust that this is a skill that will take you far in life and in your career. Even Google Engineers do it (See [Resources](/resources/core-eq-resources.md)).
    Set your intention by naming when you will commit to practicing mindfulness.  
    - __Reflect.__ In the `my-reflections-sprint-3` file, answer the questions under the `Mindfulness`heading.
    

3. __Listening and Looping__ 
    - Partner up with someone in your cohort 
    - Spend 2 minutes each, listening and looping. 
    - Reflect

    __The Prompt:__ Talk about a time in the last Sprint when you felt triggered - Something difficult that came up which was challenging in some way. 

    1. Organise to pair with someone in your cohort or accountability group. If you end up doing pairing with more than one person then great - the more you practice, the better you get. 

    2. Set a timer for 2 minutes 

    3. Person A: Using the prompt, talk until the timer ends.
    4. Person B: Practice mindful listening. You're going to listen attentively, the same way that you pay attention to your breath, you're going to pay attention to your partner and just be awake to whats happening. Be awake to whats going on. 
    
    5. After 2 minutes is up, Person B is going to loop back what you heard. Person A can then add little bits in or agree. Keep looping until you agree on that what was said has been looped back.

    6. Using the reflection file anser the questions under `Listening and Looping`.
    Stage, commit and push!
