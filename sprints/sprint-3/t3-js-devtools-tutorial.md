# DevTools Tutorial

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this tutorial, you should be familiar with and able to :

- Navigate and edit a website's HTML and CSS elements using the Chrome DevTools inspector  
- Use DevTools to manipulate elements in the DOM 
- Use DevTools console and other commands 
- Examine network and resources 


## Summary
All major browsers include developer tools, which enable developers to examine the code of a webpage or app, as well as run tests and evaluate metrics related to that code. Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short) is the industry standard. 
DevTools allows us to access the DOM and assists us with testing and debugging websites and applications. 

In this exercise you'll be downloading the source files and following the DevTools tutorial.
