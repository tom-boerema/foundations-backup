# Learning JavaScript

### Learning Competencies 
By the end of this course, you should be familiar with:

- Variables and Object types 
- Datatypes  
- Manipulating strings, arrays and objects  
- Using comments in code 
- If/else statements  
- Switch statements  
- Using console.log  
- Using and understanding scope  
- Declaring functions  
- Returning things from functions  
- Explaining the difference between arguments and parameters  
- Using `do`/`while` loops  
- Using `for` loops  
- Using `map` higher order function 


## Summary
JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language that is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. We've curated a selection of online resources to induct you into the world of JavaScript. 

The resources are geared to span all learner types - beginning with Visual and Audial tutorials, followed by practical challenges to solve and optional reading resources. 

## Timebox and Challenges

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Activity Course | 10 hours
FreeCodeCamp Challenges | 10 hours
Reflect | 1 hour

## Preparing for surprises
Just like everything on the web, applications and services (such as FreeCodeCamp and Udacity) have their bugs. There could be times where your solution is perfect, but FreeCodeCamp is throwing an error. If this is the case, be sure to query it, and discern where the issue is stemming from. Using the exact name of the challenge helps get better results. Remember, one of your tasks as budding web developer, is to query errors and find the source of them! If it's FreeCodeCamp, you'll likely discussion about it on the forums and potentially recommendations also. If all else fails, skip ahead to the next challenge. 

## Timebox Courses - Visual Audial 
These are, what we believe to be, the best three JavaScript tutorials. Use them to familiarise yourself with the concepts and get a good overview of where you are headed. Try not to get lost in the details - you'll get plenty of practice in the next FreeCodeCamp step. 

It's unlikely you'll have time to do all 3 courses - so have a try and choose which one fits best. 

A powerful combo is the Practical JavaScript course with Kirupa's diagrams (in the read section) as a supplement. 

_Pro-tip: Always Speed up the video's as you watch them - especially if they are there for an overview_   
_Pro-tip: Don't spend time on the history of JS. Focus on the learning competencies._

- [Kirupa's Basic JavaScript Course](https://www.kirupa.com/javascript_basics/index.htm)  


## FreeCodeCamp - Practical 
Now you get the jist, it's time to solve FreeCodeCamp's challenges. Each of them have been written to be solved within 2 minutes. So keep that in mind. If you're stuck beyond that, take a break, ask a friend, check the source of the error - remember at times even FreeCodeCamp throws bugs. 

1. Sign-up or sign-in to FreeCodeCamp using your __GitHub__ account.  
2. Complete their Basic JavaScript [course](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript)  

## JavaScript - Reading (optional)
- [E-book Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - _chapters 1-4_  
- [Kirupa's Basic JavaScript Course](https://www.kirupa.com/javascript_basics/index.htm) 'Read' options 
- [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)
